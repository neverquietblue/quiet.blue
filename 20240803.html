            this is the start to my new journal! i will attempt to make entries semi-regularly or when id like to share some thoughts or something.
            i will also attempt to post about what im doing, like music, visual art, photography and other projects im a part of.
            ill also be sharing stuff i like sometimes or things ive looked in to. i guess i can start by just putting one of these images from 
            my argus dc1512 toy camera that i like to take with me places.

    i took this one at a nearby lake. its one of my favorite spots in my local area, 
    but i do have to drive a little bit to get to it so i mostly only like to go when my spirits are high.

<p>
    something else id like to share is this analog synth jam i recorded several days ago. the main pieces of the
    project were put together using an arturia microbrute which, because its a monophonic synth, required the use of multiple
    takes in order to get a layered sound. i used the in-built step sequencer for the initial underlying run of the track and
    added extra little things overtop like a bassline and some other takes of the same sequence only pitched up and ran through
    a myriad of effects.
